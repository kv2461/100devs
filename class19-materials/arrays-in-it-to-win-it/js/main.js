//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movieArray = ["Fight Club", "Avengers End-Game", "Entourage"];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = movieArray[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let movieArrayLength = movieArray.length
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastMovie = [movieArray.length-1];
